Replaces your IDE's progress bars with random Pok&eacute;mon. The configuration lives under Preferences > Appearance & Behaviour > Pok&eacute;mon Progress. The chosen Pok&eacute;mon are configurable, though all are used by default. Different trail paint themes may be chosen. Pok&eacute;mon sprites may also be turned off to only use the type colours, for a more professional look.
